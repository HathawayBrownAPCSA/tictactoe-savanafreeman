Good stuff all around here!
Nice job incorporating the work from class and also some of your own touches.
Orange and Pink?  Really?

Anyway, two small things: 
(1) the second game starts with "O" instead of "X".
    Don't know whether that's a feature or a bug.
    How do you play against others?  Do you alternate?
(2) The middle column win doesn't check right - there's one number
    in the wrong place.  (also your comments are in the wrong place -
    you label the check-rows-for-winner comparissons "vertical check",
    for instance.
    
Overall, some good work.  Keep it up!
